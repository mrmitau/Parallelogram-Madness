# Parallelogram-Madness
Response for "Need For Code" challenge from Venturesity

There are 3 classes - Madness, MyPoint, MyQuadrilateral

Madness has the main logic, with user input process

MyPoint is a class created to handle each input coordinate as an object, primarily for sorting purposes (idea is to arrange
in a cyclic order starting from bottom-left, bottom-right, top-right and top-left)

MyQuadrilateral class is build to handle calculating length of all sides, with a member function with logic to determine if 
the given quadrilateral is a parallelogram or not.
